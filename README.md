"Damn, you’re becoming sexier every day.”
 
She whispers to my right ear laughing. 

We spend what feels like an hour just kissing, 
talking, and making a strong touch. My body on 
fire, and its sweet relief when our clothes come
off. 

Our bodies fit together beautifully. 
We finally have that next-level intimacy we’ve 
both been craving for years. And when I thought 
I had lost her, was when life finally began. 
I open my eyes and she is right there staring at
 me with those baby blues. 

“I love you,” she says. 

Our limbs are tangled together, and we spend a
long-time kissing. I can’t remember ever feeling 
so happy and h*rny. We lounge in bed, naked, sipping 
and chatting. We’re both starving, but hungry for 
more, leaving wet trails of kisses on my forehead as 
she sits on my belly. She stares back. She feels the
emotions. 

Is brunch our first official date? We’re holding hands 
across the table at Cjs. It’s strange that we’ve 
professed our love for one another, had sex, and are 
only now having our first meal together. We are totally 
making memories for ourselves. 
Hearts that were broken but are now together. 

The superior taste of her voice made me smile.  I fell in love with the way her voice soothed me.  I was feeling it.  She was nervous.  Her eyes were set on the floor.  Her comfortability.  Something in her eyes sparkled eagerness. 

Our growing love. You
